# Glitchy Cyborg
Initially started as web application front end for public access to SOC hobby cluster, the project has since pivoted since the network security aspects of the project is just a nightmare and not what I really wanted to focus on. Mostly worked as a learn-by doing project for html/css/PHP/JS/MySQL and linux security.
