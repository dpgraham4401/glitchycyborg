	Glitchy Cyborg is currently underconstruction.
	Thank you for visiting, Come back in a couple  months! :)
	<p>In the meantime, here's a picture of a

	<h1 id="About"> About </h1>
	<p>Glitchy Cyborg is the front end for my personal "super" computer, Gaea.
	The joke here bing that it made of small ARM architecture quad core single board computers
	</p>

	<p>It's not intended to do any real serious computations but for those looking to develop
	test or maybe just play around.
	I'm making it available to others for a couple reason, mostly learning purposes.
	
	<p> Please keep in mind, I'm no expert, just passionately curious</p>

	<h1 id="Tech Specs"> Technical Specs </h1>
	<p>Gaea consist of a 5 <a href="https://www.pine64.org/devices/
	single-board-computers/rock64/">Rock64</a> single board computers from Pine64
	Like most SOCs, the ROCK64 uses ARM cores which use a reduced Instruction (RISC)
	and are considered more power efficient than their CISC counteparts</p>

	<p>The cluster uses a Beowolf architecture (1 login node, 4 slave nodes)
	with 64 Gb of steady state scratch storage. Additional info can be found at
